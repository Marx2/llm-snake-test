# Snake Game

## Introduction
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake to collect food while avoiding collisions with walls and itself. This implementation is written in Python using the Pygame library.

## Features
- **Scoring System**: Tracks the player's score as the snake collects food.
- **Collision Detection**: Ends the game when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- **Dynamic Food Spawning**: Food appears at random locations on the screen.
- **Responsive Controls**: Use arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
